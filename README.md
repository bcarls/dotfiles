# dotfiles

This repository stores all of my dotfiles. To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/bcarls/dotfiles .
chmod +x .setup_dotfiles.sh
./.setup_dotfiles.sh
```

## Plugins

They are handled by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Plugins can trivially installed via the .vimrc. vim-plug will install the plugins on the first install.

## Where does this all come from?

The inspiration comes from this Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3cohmv/manage_dotfiles_with_vimplug_and_github/). The guys repo is [here](https://github.com/binaryplease/dotfiles).
